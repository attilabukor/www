Beer Vegetable Curry
====================

A rather unusual curry that I made up which turned out to be pretty good. I will keep on working on this and adding changes each time I prepare it.

The name too, is not final, since I'm not even sure if this qualifies as a curry.

Ingredients
-----------

 * 3 plum tomatoes
 * &frac14; rocoto
 * &frac12; green bell pepper
 * Canola oil
 * Ground coriander
 * 3 Medium-sized potatoes (cubed, about 10-15mm size)
 * 1 Cup (~200mL) of red lentils
 * 1 Carrot (slices, about 7-8mm thick)
 * 1 Cup of peas (you can use a full can if you used canned peas)
 * 1 plum tomato (cubed)
 * 1 spoonful of curry powder
 * 1 spoonful of paprika
 * 1 spoonful of ground red pepper
 * &frac34; spoonful of cumin
 * &frac12; spoonful of ginger
 * 1 glass (~250mL) of beer.
 * 2 spoonfuls of corn starch

For the beer, I used Antares' [Barley Wine](http://www.cervezaantares.com/beers.php?iId=5). You'll probably have to pick something more of your liking that you can find locally.

Preparation
-----------

Boil the 3 potatos on one side until they're soft, but not squishy.  
Boil the lentils on another pot until they're also soft, but not squishy.  
Blend the tomatoes, rocoto and green bell pepper all together.  

Pour a bit of canola oil into a wok (about enough to cover the bottom and sides), and let it heat for a bit. Add the coriander, and leave it be for about 15-30 seconds.  
Add the blended tomatoes to the mixture, and let that cook for about 3-4 minutes.

After those 3-4 minutes, add the potatoes, lentils, carrots the remaining tomato and all the remaining spices to the preparation and let it cook for 4 more minutes.  
Meanwhile, start gradually adding the beer gradually, so as to slightly cover the food as the it slowly evaporates.

Finally, add the corn strach, which should add some consistency to the dish. After turning off the fire let it sooth for a minute or two before serving.
