title: Lentil Empanadas
---

[Empanadas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empanadas) are a stuff pastry
(usually eaten using ones hands), extremely common in Argentina, though the
traditional stuffing include [meats and
eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiocentrism).  
While I had no idea what I was doing when I started this vegan variation,
it turned out extremely good, and relatively simple, especially to
prepare in very large quantities.

Ingredients
-----------

 * Olive oil
 * 3 small onions, miniprimmed
 * &frac12; large red bell pepper, miniprimmed
 * &frac12; spoonful coriander
 * &frac12;-&#8532; spoonful curry powder
 * &frac12; spoonful cumin
 * 100-150g spaniach
 * 1 large cup red lentil
 * 2 handfuls olives, sliced
 * Empanada doughs. These units roughly fill up about 20.

Preparation
-----------

Boil the lentil for about 10-15 minutes to cook them and make the softer. You
dont want them all squish, though, so be careful.

Cut the onions and red bell pepper very small. I ran them through a minipimer
(separately) for a few pulses. You still want it to be solid pieces.

Was the spinach thoroughly, and cut it into bits. I just used a pair of
scissors and cut it about 2-3cm long bits.

Cover the bottom of a pan or wok with olive oil and heat it for a bit. Add the
coriander, and let that heat for about 20 seconds. Add the onions, stir a few
times, and then add the curry powder. Cook the onions for a minute or two, and
then add the red pepper. Continue cooking for a couple more minutes while
constantly stiring.  
Finally, add the cumin, lentil and spinach. Cook for about two more minutue
while still stiring.

After cooking, add the sliced olived, and let the mixture cool for 5-10
minutes. Then fill the doughs, close, and cook in an oven and medium-high.
